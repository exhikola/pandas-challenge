PyCity Schools Analysis

All the project data source is based in two files. Which are merged from the 'School Name' which is the information incommon for botth files.
-First file contains information about the school and the second file contains information about students. 
This is the information used for the analyses.
1.student_name
2.gender	
3.grade	school_name	
4.reading_score	math_score
5.type	
6.size	
7.budget

-District Summary
On this section I have done all the summary for total numbers of schools, students, sum of the total budget, mean of the math &reading score, also the passing rate of Math & reading and the overall passing.
I did a summary by using dataframe.

-School Summary
On this section I have done the calculation as it is required for the students.

First step that helps to retrieve the data I need for the report,is to group the school_data_complete file by "school_name"

After all the calculation for :School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math	% Passing Reading, % Overall Passing Rate.
All this information is used to create a DataFrame named per_school_summary, with will help for the further analyses.


Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) and Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
Its noticed that the school which have lower budget has higher rate of overall passing, and the school budget is higher but overall passing rate is lower.


Math Scores by Grade and Reading Score by Grade

By this calculation seem that all the grades from 9th to 12th and schools have similar changes.

Scores by School Size

Schools that are considered large have lower passing rate than medium and small schools.

Scores by School Type
The result its very clear that Charter Schools have higher passing rate in math, reading.
